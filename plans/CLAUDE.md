# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Python Commands
**Always use `uv run` for running anything related to Python.**

- **Server**: `uv run python -m llmvm2.server`
- **Client**: `uv run python -m llmvm2.client`
- **CLI**: `uv run python -m llmvm2.cli`
- **Install dependencies**: `uv sync` or `pip install -e .`
- **Run tests**: `uv run pytest tests/`

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

**llmvm2** is a simplified, clean reimplementation of LLMVM with focus on:
- Minimal client-server architecture
- Python runtime with bash helper execution
- Conversations API for state management
- WebSocket streaming server
- Clean separation of concerns

### Directory Structure

- **`llmvm2/server/`**: Server components
  - `orchestrator.py`: Coordinates LLM calls and execution
  - `python_runtime.py`: Python code execution environment
  - `bash_helper.py`: Bash command execution helper
  - `api/server.py`: WebSocket server implementation
  - `prompts/`: System prompts and templates

- **`llmvm2/client/`**: Minimal terminal client
  - CLI interface for interacting with the server
  - Message rendering and user input handling

- **`llmvm2/common/`**: Shared components
  - `config/`: Configuration and dependency injection
  - `utils/`: Utilities including performance tracking
  - LLM executors for different providers

- **`tests/`**: Test suite
  - Unit tests for core components
  - Integration tests for client-server communication

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Simplified Execution Model**: The core execution flow:
1. User input â†’ Server orchestrator
2. LLM generates response with optional code blocks
3. Python runtime executes code blocks
4. Results streamed back to client via WebSocket
5. Continue until task complete

**Conversations API**: Manages conversation state, message history, and context. Provides clean separation between conversation management and execution.

**Dependency Injection**: Uses `container.py` for clean dependency management and configuration.

### Configuration

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude models
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI models
  - Additional provider keys as needed

- **Logging**: Structured logging to `logs/` directory with performance tracking

## Development Notes

- This is a clean, simplified implementation focusing on core LLMVM functionality
- Python runtime executes code in isolated environment with bash helper support
- WebSocket server provides real-time streaming of LLM responses
- Minimal dependencies compared to original LLMVM
- Focus on maintainability and testability
